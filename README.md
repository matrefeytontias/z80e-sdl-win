z80e-sdl-win
============

z80e port to Windows, only including the SDL frontend. Based on https://github.com/KnightOS/z80e . If you use a POSIX system, you are strongly advised to download the original instead.

Building from source
====================

For now, only Visual Studio 2012 or higher has been tested for compiling z80e-sdl-win. Just open z80e-sdl.sln and build the solution.

Using z80e-sdl-win
==================

z80e-sdl-win is used in the exact same way as z80e. You can refer to https://github.com/KnightOS/z80e/blob/master/README.md or run `z80e-sdl-win.exe --help` in a command-line interface to see usage information.
